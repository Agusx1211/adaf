  "description": "Three CLI files exceed 700 lines: stats_cmd.go (773), spawn.go (769), plan.go (740). Split per-subcommand. Extract formatTimeAgo/formatDuration from stats_cmd.go to helpers.go. Normalize minor error handling inconsistencies. Issue 26 cleanup was effective - this is incremental polish. Relates to phase p4-agent-cleanup.",
