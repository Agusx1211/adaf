  "description": "claude.go, gemini.go, and opencode.go Run() implementations are nearly identical (build args, start process, pipe stdout, parse stream, forward events). Extract a StreamRunner struct that takes a Parser and ArgsBuilder function to reduce per-agent code by ~50%. Also: standardize process group usage for vibe/generic agents, and remove unused agent.Register() export from registry.go. Relates to phase p4-agent-cleanup.",
