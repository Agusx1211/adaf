  "description": "AppModel has 87 fields spanning unrelated concerns. Decompose into 6 sub-models: SelectorScreen, PlanScreen, ProfileWizard, LoopWizard, SettingsScreen, RolesRulesEditor. Each owns its state enum, Update, and View. Also centralize duplicated split-pane rendering (settings_roles_rules.go:120 vs loop.go:630), replace scroll capability switches with map, move status-help to per-screen providers. Relates to phase p3-tui-refactor.",
