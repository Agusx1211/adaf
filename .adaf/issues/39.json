  "title": "TUI: separate solved and unsolved issues in list view",
  "description": "The TUI issue view does not visually separate solved and unsolved issues. Everything is mixed together, which makes it hard to scan active work and verify completion status quickly.\n\nExpected behavior:\n- Clearly split issues by status in the TUI list (e.g., unsolved vs solved/done/wontfix).\n- Maintain clear section headers and/or ordering so open/active items are prioritized.\n- Preserve existing CLI behavior and filters, but improve TUI discoverability for state.\n\nThis is a UX issue for active session operators that rely on the TUI for quick triage and task management.",
