  "title": "Define split for .adaf scope: commit shared project state, keep session telemetry local",
  "description": "Proposal:\n\n- Keep two categories of `.adaf` state separate:\n  - Structural/project knowledge: plans, issues, decisions, docs, config (durable, collaborative, commit-friendly).\n  - Operational telemetry: recordings, sessions, active loop/spawn/worktree runtime state (large/noisy/sensitive).\n\nSuggested structure:\n.adaf/\n  plan.json\n  issues/\n  decisions/\n  docs/\n  config.json\n  local/\n    sessions/\n    recordings/\n    loops/\n    spawns/\n\nNotes:\n1) Structural artifacts should remain in `./.adaf/` and be committed so cloned repos immediately carry relay context (plans/issues/docs/decisions).\n2) Full session recordings should stay local-only (or under ignored local subdir) because they are chatty and may contain secrets.\n3) Raw session logs/recordings are operational and should not be committed by default; summaries/digests can be committed as part of project memory if useful.\n4) `adaf` CLI should auto-commit structural mutations (`issue`, `plan`, `decision`, etc.) with standardized message prefix, e.g. `adaf: create issue #NN ...`, while making this behavior configurable for users who prefer manual batching.\n5) Agents should never mutate `.adaf` files directly; they call `adaf` commands and CLI handles persistence/commit policy.\n6) Humans can still manually edit `.adaf` JSON when needed.\n\nOpen question for implementation: should operational data be moved under `./.adaf/local/` (gitignored) versus `~/.adaf/<project-hash>/`? The current repository hint suggests intent for both",
