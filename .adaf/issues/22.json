  "description": "## Location\n- internal/orchestrator/orchestrator.go:1025-1070\n\n## Problem\nPolls every 250ms with GetSpawn calls for all pending spawns. Each call reads from the file-based store with flock. Under high spawn counts this creates unnecessary disk I/O and lock contention.\n\n## Fix\nUse channel-based notification from onSpawnComplete instead of polling the store.",
